		<h1>Fleet Bio:</h1>
		<p>We are a small fleet in the game Steel Ocean. We feel the need to rise against the<br>
		oppressing fleets, such as; Dark Judge, DIIN, Bonkers, and Goons. These fleets have devoted<br>
		themselves to reaking havoc in the game. We, the Confederacy, aim to break the grips of these fleets by<br>
		providing a safe, friendly, and cheat free gaming environment. On our free time, we enjoy talking about<br> 
		WWII history. Specificaly WWII Naval conflict and tactics. If you feel the need to join the rebellion,<br>
		just feel free to apply.</p>
